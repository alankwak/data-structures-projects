# data-structures-projects

A holding place for some of the projects I created in my DSA class. 

```BoggleBoardSolver``` solves a puzzle/game named "Boggle" (look it up if you haven't heard of it). It is akin to the New York Times' Connections game. You have to find words based on letters in a grid. It uses a custom-made trie.

```GridPathSolver``` solves a class data structures problem -- find a path from the start position to the end position in a grid. Some "nodes" of the grid are blocked off. I've implemented a backtracking solver that finds a single path from the start to the end using a custom-made stack (made from a doubly-linked list). While it wasn't required as part of the class, I've also added a method to find the shortest path using breadth-first search and a custom-made queue (also made from a doubly-linked list).
